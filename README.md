## Ground Cricket Chirps
### Tasks
1. Find the linear regression equation for this data.
2. Chart the original data and the equation on the chart.
3. Find the equation's  R^2 score (use the .score method) to determine whether the equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)
4. Extrapolate data: If the ground temperature reached 95Â° F, then at what approximate rate would you expect the crickets to be chirping?
5. Interpolate data: With a listening device, you discovered that on a particular morning the crickets were chirping at a rate of 18 chirps per second. What was the approximate ground temperature that morning?

## Brain vs Body Weight
### Tasks
1. Find the linear regression equation for this data for brain weight to body weight.
2. Chart the original data and the equation on the chart.
3. Find the equation's R^2 score (use the .score method) to determine whether the equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)

##Salary Discrimination
### Tasks
1. Find the linear regression equation for this data using columns 1-5 to column 6.
2. Find the selection of columns with the best R2 score.
3. Report whether sex is a factor in salary. Support your argument with graph(s) if appropriate.
